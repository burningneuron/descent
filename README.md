Descent Overlord's Helper

An app to help the overlord player in Descent: Journeys in the Dark.

The idea is to select the products you own, a particular quest encounter, 
and get a list of valid monsters for that encounter, limited by those 
monsters you own.

Ultimately I'd like to have an ad-hoc trait selector that will pull up 
monsters for homebrew quests as well.
